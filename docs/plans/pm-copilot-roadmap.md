2. **Slack Channel**: `/extensions/slack/index.ts`
3. **Browser Tool**: `/src/agents/tools/browser-tool.ts`
4. **Agent Framework**: `/src/agents/pi-agents.ts`
5. **Gateway Server**: `/src/gateway/server.impl.ts`
6. **Tool Registration**: `/src/agents/openclaw-tools.ts`

---

---

# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Fork and Clean Up

### 1.1 Create Fork

- Fork OpenClaw repository
- Rename project (e.g., "PMClaw", "BugBot", or your preferred name)
- Update `package.json` name, description, bin entries

### 1.2 Remove Unused Extensions

Keep only essential channels:

- ✅ Keep: `/extensions/slack/` (primary)
- ❌ Remove: telegram, discord, whatsapp, signal, matrix, line, etc. (32+ extensions)
- ✅ Keep: `/extensions/memory-lancedb/` (context memory)

### 1.3 Remove Unused Skills

Audit `/skills/` directory (54 packages) - keep only relevant ones

### 1.4 Update Branding

- Update UI in `/ui/`
- Update CLI name and help text
- Update documentation

---

## Phase 2: Add Jira Integration

### 2.1 Create Jira Extension

**Location**: `/extensions/jira/`

```
extensions/jira/
├── index.ts          # Plugin entry point
├── api.ts            # Jira REST API client
├── types.ts          # TypeScript types for Jira entities
└── EXTENSION.yaml    # Extension metadata
```

### 2.2 Jira API Features to Implement

- Authentication (OAuth 2.0 or API token)
- Create/update/transition issues
- Search issues (JQL queries)
- Get issue details and comments
- Add comments to issues
- Assign issues
- Get project metadata

### 2.3 Register Jira Tools

Use OpenClaw plugin API in `/extensions/jira/index.ts`:

```typescript
plugin.registerTool({
  name: "jira_create_issue",
  description: "Create a new Jira issue",
  // ... schema and handler
});

plugin.registerTool({
  name: "jira_search",
  description: "Search Jira issues with JQL",
  // ...
});

plugin.registerTool({
  name: "jira_update_issue",
  description: "Update a Jira issue",
  // ...
});
```

---

## Phase 3: Build Bug Triage Workflow

### 3.1 Slack → Jira Flow

When a bug is reported in Slack:

1. AI agent extracts bug details (title, description, steps to reproduce)
2. Agent uses browser tool to check product app/website if needed
3. Agent creates Jira issue with extracted details
4. Agent responds in Slack thread with Jira link
5. Agent can browse product to gather screenshots/context

### 3.2 Create Bug Triage Skill

**Location**: `/skills/bug-triage/`

```
skills/bug-triage/
├── index.ts          # Skill entry point
├── SKILL.md          # Skill documentation
└── prompts/          # Agent prompt templates
    ├── extract-bug.md
    └── triage.md
```

### 3.3 Slack Command Integration

- `/bug <description>` - Quick bug report
- React with 🐛 emoji to flag messages as bugs
- Mention @PMBot to triage a thread

### 3.4 Key Workflow Components

1. **Message Parser**: Extract bug details from Slack messages
2. **Context Gatherer**: Use browser to capture screenshots/state
3. **Issue Creator**: Create well-formatted Jira tickets
4. **Thread Tracker**: Track Slack thread ↔ Jira issue relationship

---

## Phase 4: Browser Integration for Product Monitoring

### 4.1 Leverage Existing Browser Tool

The browser tool at `/src/agents/tools/browser-tool.ts` already supports:

- Navigate to product URLs
- Take screenshots
- Execute JavaScript to check app state
- Fill forms to reproduce bugs

### 4.2 Product-Specific Automation

Add skills for:

- Screenshot product pages for bug reports
- Check if a bug is reproducible
- Monitor product health/status pages

| Zoom/Meet joining                       | ❌ Not built | -                                                  |
| Google Docs                             | ❌ Not built | -                                                  |

#### Meeting Intelligence Options

**Option A: Meeting Bot Integration (Recommended for MVP)**
Integrate with existing meeting bot platforms instead of building from scratch:

```
extensions/recall-ai/          # Recall.ai meeting bot API
  - Join Zoom/Meet/Teams automatically
  - Get transcripts via webhook
  - No need to handle audio/video ourselves
```

**Pros:** Fast to build, handles all platforms, high quality
**Cons:** Third-party dependency, per-meeting cost (~$0.02-0.05/min)

**Flow:**

```
1. PM has meeting on calendar
2. Recall.ai bot joins meeting automatically
3. Transcript webhook fires when meeting ends
4. PM Co-Pilot processes transcript:
   - Extracts action items
   - Creates Jira tickets for commitments
   - Updates Notion with meeting notes
   - Sends summary to Slack
```

**Option B: Calendar + Notes Sync (Simpler)**
Don't join meetings, but integrate with where notes are taken:

```
extensions/google-calendar/    # Read calendar events
extensions/google-docs/        # Read/write meeting notes
extensions/google-drive/       # Access recordings
```

**Flow:**

```
1. Read calendar to know what meetings are scheduled
2. Before meeting: Generate prep brief from context
3. During meeting: PM takes notes in Google Doc
4. After meeting: PM Co-Pilot reads notes, extracts action items
```

**Pros:** No meeting bot cost, simpler, PM stays in control
**Cons:** Manual note-taking, less automated

**Option C: Audio Upload + Transcription (Budget)**
Leverage existing transcription pipeline:

**Flow:**

```
1. PM records meeting locally (Zoom cloud recording, QuickTime, etc.)
2. PM uploads audio file to PM Co-Pilot
3. Whisper/Deepgram transcribes
4. AI processes transcript
```

**Pros:** Uses existing transcription infra, no API costs
**Cons:** Manual upload step, delay in processing

**Option D: Full Meeting Bot (Build from Scratch)**
Build native integrations with meeting platforms:

```
extensions/zoom-bot/           # Zoom Meeting SDK
extensions/google-meet-bot/    # Google Meet API (limited)
extensions/teams-bot/          # MS Teams Meeting SDK
```

**Pros:** Full control, no third-party dependency
**Cons:** Complex to build, months of work, certification required

## Technical Considerations

### Authentication Strategy

- OAuth 2.0 for most integrations (Google, Zoom, etc.)
- API tokens for Jira, Linear, etc.
- Secure credential storage (keychain / encrypted config)

### Data Privacy

- All data stays local or in PM's own accounts
- No sending data to third parties
- Clear audit log of AI actions
- Undo capability for autonomous actions

### Rate Limits & Quotas

- Respect API rate limits across integrations
- Queue non-urgent operations
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Implementation Phases for UI

#### UI Phase 1: Enhanced Web Dashboard

**Goal**: Make existing `/ui/` PM-friendly

- Add onboarding flow (wizard-style, not form-heavy)
- Add visual integration cards (not JSON config)
- Add daily brief dashboard view
- Add dark/light mode
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Effort**: Medium (builds on existing Lit codebase)

#### UI Phase 2: Mac App Polish

**Goal**: Transform menu bar app into full PM experience

- SwiftUI main window with dashboard
- Native onboarding flow
- Menu bar quick actions
- Spotlight integration
- Native notifications
- Auto-start on login option

**Effort**: Medium-High (extend existing Swift foundation)

#### UI Phase 3: Hosted SaaS

**Goal**: Cloud-hosted version for zero-install experience

- User authentication (Clerk/Auth0)
- Team/org workspaces
- Billing (Stripe)
- Usage analytics
- Admin console

**Effort**: High (new infrastructure)

#### UI Phase 4: Windows App

**Goal**: Windows native app for enterprise

- Electron or Tauri wrapper
- Windows-native notifications
- System tray integration
- MSI installer for IT deployment

**Effort**: Medium (can reuse web UI)

### UI Design Principles for PMs

1. **No JSON editing** - All config via visual forms
2. **No CLI required** - Everything accessible via GUI
3. **OAuth for everything** - No copy-pasting API tokens
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, reveal power features
5. **Contextual help** - Tooltips and guides everywhere
6. **Instant feedback** - Loading states, success confirmations
7. **Mobile-first web** - Works on phone browser
8. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Power users can go fast
9. **Undo everywhere** - Reduce fear of mistakes
10. **Smart defaults** - Works out of box with minimal config

## Competitive Moats

### 1. Voice-Native AI PM (Unique)

No competitor offers voice-first PM with phone calls, transcription, and voice commands.
**Moat:** Twilio/telephony integration + local TTS + native apps

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture (Defensible)

Specialized agents that collaborate, not a single monolithic bot.
**Moat:** Complex orchestration, per-agent memory, cross-agent routing

### 3. Mobile-First with Canvas (Rare)

Live dashboards rendering on mobile devices, not just notifications.
**Moat:** Native apps + Canvas system + real-time sync

### 4. 37+ Channel Integrations (Comprehensive)

Reach PMs wherever they work - Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, iMessage.
**Moat:** Years of integration work, protocol expertise

### 5. Offline-First Privacy (Enterprise Trust)

Data stays local, works offline, no cloud dependency.
**Moat:** Local-first architecture, self-hosted option

### 6. Memory That Learns (Sticky)

AI remembers decisions, preferences, stakeholder context across months.
**Moat:** LanceDB integration, auto-recall/capture, no context reset
